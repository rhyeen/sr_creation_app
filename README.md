# Shardrealms App - Front-end

## Introduction

Please see the parent repository, [sr_creation](https://github.com/rhyeen/sr_creation) for more details.

## Setup

To setup the app on your local machine, make sure to have `NPM` and `Node.js` installed.  You can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You'll also want to install [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) via npm.

Next, in the root directory of the repo, run `npm install`.

If you run into an error, something is wrong.  Depreciation warnings are expected.

## Develop

### Running the server

You can run an instance on your local machine by first following **Setup**, then running `npm start`.  This will start the pm2 watched Node server that can be accessed via localhost:4000.

All issues should be reported on the centralized sr_creation repo: https://github.com/rhyeen/sr_creation/issues
Any issue reported here will just be closed.

This is because several issues/features have to deal with a combination or front-end, back-end, and database concerns
and it is easier for the community to focus on one issue knowledge base than several.
